## Steps:

### 1. Data Collection and Exploration:

- **Collect Data:** Obtain a dataset containing mobile features and prices.
- **Explore Data:** Analyze the dataset for structure, missing values, and correlations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:

- **Handle Missing Values:** Impute or remove missing values.
- **Encode Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical variables to numerical representations.
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardize or normalize numerical features.

### 3. Split the Data:

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 or 70/30).

### 4. Model Training:

#### 4.1 Logistic Regression:

- Fit a logistic regression model.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.

#### 4.2 Decision Tree:

- Train a decision tree classification model.
- Tune hyperparameters if needed.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

#### 4.3 Random Forest:

- Train a random forest classification model.
- Tune hyperparameters.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

#### 4.4 XGBoost:

- Implement XGBoost classification.
- Tune hyperparameters.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

#### 4.5 Support Vector Classifier (SVC):

- Train a Support Vector Classifier.
- Tune hyperparameters.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

#### 4.6 Naive Bayes:

- Implement a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation:

- Compare the performance of each model on the testing set.
- Choose the model with the best performance for predicting mobile prices.

Feel free to adjust hyperparameters, experiment with different models, and customize the code based on your specific dataset.
